Predicting Customer Purchase Behavior:
A Binary Classification Model for E-Commerce Websites

Will a user make purchase in that particular browser session ?

To build a model that will predict if a customer makes a purchase during their website session by using features such as session duration, region and browser type. The target variable for the model will be whether or not a purchase was made and the input features are other columns in the dataset. The model's performance will be evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting the "Revenue" column. Thus, we shall develop a binary classification model to predict customer purchase behavior on a given website. This model can be helpful for the sales & marketing department to analyze what attracts a user and also incentivize with curated coupons or offers.

The dataset includes features from over 12,330 sessions with 18 attributes (10 numerical and 8 categorical) that provide insight into the behavior of visitors on an e-commerce website, including the number of pages visited and time spent on each type of page. Moreover, metrics such as "Bounce Rate", "Exit Rate", and "Page Value" measured by "Google Analytics" are also taken into consideration. Additional features include "Special Day", which indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day, and "Page Value" which represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction. The dataset also includes information about the visitor's operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type, whether the date of the visit is a weekend, and the month of the year.
